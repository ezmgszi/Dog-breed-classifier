# Predicitng Pooches
# Dog Breed Classification Project

This project aims to classify dog breeds using convolutional neural networks. The code is contained in a Jupyter Notebook.

## Prerequisites

- A Google account (for accessing Google Colab) or other Jupyter notbook platform

## Getting Started
## Getting Started

1. Open Google Colab (https://colab.research.google.com/) and sign in with your Google account.

2. In Google Colab, click on `File` in the menu and select `Open notebook`.

3. Open the `Predicting Pooches.ipynb` notebook file.

## Running the Notebook
1. In the notbooke, you can specifiy the modle save path before running. 

2. To run the entire notebook, click `Runtime` in the menu, then `Run all`. Alternatively, you can run each cell individually by clicking on a cell and pressing `Shift + Enter`.
- If you run the entire notbook it will train each model, THIS IS A 12+ HOUR TASK SO PROBABLY DONT WANT TO DO THIS

3. The notebook will execute the code in each cell and display the output below the respective cell.

4. You can modify the code in the cells and re-run them to experiment with different configurations or settings.

Please refer to the comments and markdown cells within the notebook for more information about the code and its functionality.
